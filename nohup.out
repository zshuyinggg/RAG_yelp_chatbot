Key Reviews: The Yenta pastrami bao is incredible, a great concoction of fusion fast casual food.

Key Reviews: Food is amazing here. Try crab and pork juicy buns and siu mai.|**REVIEW_SEPARATOR**|Dim Sum garden is my favorite Shanghai restaurant that I have encountered as of yet in America.  The highlight of the whole place is the xiao long bao also known as soup buns.  For the uninitiated these are buns which are delicately made with thin shells and filled with steaming hot soup which consists of pork and broth.  They are to die for but one must also be careful not to have the hot soup squirt out on them which can sometimes be a difficult task.  This place has the best soup buns I have had since I have been to Shanghai. I am serious about this as I have been to Flushing and Chinatown and not found any as tasty as these. They are succulent and flavorful and warm you up from the inside.  

Now let's tackle the rest of the menu.  The menu is really trying to cater to all tastes. It has traditional Shanghai dishes to Americanized Chinese food and just plain Fried Chicken with French Fries.  The di...

Key Reviews: We ordered take out one night, feeling Thai, not really sure where to go, and found this place and saw the good reviews. I tried to order fresh spring rolls, but they didn't have them, so I got coconut chicken soup- which was very good! I ordered red chicken curry and my husband got drunken noodles with shrimp. Both were so boring, and for $15 a piece we were both disappointed. We both also requested spicy and neither of us got it. It seems like other dishes might be better, but we most likely won't go back again. Sorry, Ratchada, we wanted to like you.|**REVIEW_SEPARATOR**|Ordered delivery today which arrived on time and still hot. Spring rolls, beef drunken noodles, and chicken satay.

Key Reviews: We ordered take out one night, feeling Thai, not really sure where to go, and found this place and saw the good reviews. I tried to order fresh spring rolls, but they didn't have them, so I got coconut chicken soup- which was very good! I ordered red chicken curry and my husband got drunken noodles with shrimp. Both were so boring, and for $15 a piece we were both disappointed. We both also requested spicy and neither of us got it. It seems like other dishes might be better, but we most likely won't go back again. Sorry, Ratchada, we wanted to like you.|**REVIEW_SEPARATOR**|Ordered delivery today which arrived on time and still hot. Spring rolls, beef drunken noodles, and chicken satay. Everything was delicious and the portion sizes are generous.|**REVIEW_SEPARATOR**|Very good food, the place was empty when we visited.  Service was quick enough, and they provided some recommendations.

I started with the Laotian onion soup.  Very tasty, with a lot of vegetables, I would order this agai...

Key Reviews: The Yenta pastrami bao is incredible, a great concoction of fusion fast casual food. I just wish the fried chicken baos, which are also delicious, were a little bigger or lower the price by 75 cents. With two baos for $9+ tax and stuff, I want to be pretty satisfied. As a comparison, a Federal Donuts fried chicken sandwich is $8.|**REVIEW_SEPARATOR**|I love the customer service. They also gave ma a free Hamm's beer.
